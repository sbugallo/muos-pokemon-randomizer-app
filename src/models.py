"""Core data models for the PokÃ©mon ROM randomizer application.

This module defines the data structures and state management classes that form the backbone of the

- UI color definitions and glyph constants
- File system tree representation
- Application state management
- Step/screen workflow definition
- Button configuration models

The models use Pydantic for data validation and serialization.
